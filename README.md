#### _An application to track new animals admitted to the zoo._

#### By _**Luciano Oliveira**_

## Description

This web application allows the system administrator to add and track new animals to the zoo. you can see a list of animals added, you have the option to display a custom list, and also edit animals details that were entered in the app.

## Specifications
* User can log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
* User can view a list of animals that have been logged.
* User can see options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older)
* User can click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.

## Further Exploration that would be nice to add:

* Show animals based on diet type. Then, show all animals who eat meat (carnivores AND omnivores).
* Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
* Add a new master component to average the total age for each species.
